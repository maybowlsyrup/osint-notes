Welcome to this comprehensive guide on **penetration testing**, **open‑source intelligence (OSINT)** and **geospatial intelligence (GEOINT)**.  
The aim of this project is to provide a structured reference for learners and practitioners to understand the phases of a penetration test, gather and analyze open‑source data, and employ geolocation techniques ethically.

This repository is organized into a `/docs` directory with several subfolders containing small Markdown files.  Each folder has its own `README.md` that serves as an index, and files are linked together using relative paths.  Feel free to explore the table of contents below.

## Table of Contents

- [Methodology](docs/methodology/README.md) – phases of a penetration test (reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post‑exploitation, reporting, checklists).  
- [OSINT](docs/osint/README.md) – fundamentals, people search, domain/DNS lookups, company profiling, social media, public records, dark web basics, and operational security.
- [GEOINT](docs/geoint/README.md) – geolocation methods: EXIF metadata, reverse image search, error‑level analysis, lighting & shadows, landmarks and skyline, maps & satellite imagery, temporal clues, camera signatures, case studies and resources.
- [Tools](docs/tools/README.md) – curated lists of network, web, exploitation, traffic analysis, credentials, wireless, OSINT and GEOINT tools, each in their own files.
- [Workflows](docs/workflows/README.md) – step‑by‑step playbooks for lab setup, web application assessments, network assessments, OSINT investigations, and geolocation.
- [Reporting](docs/reporting/README.md) – templates and guidance for writing professional penetration testing reports.
- [Resources](docs/resources/README.md) – books, blogs, newsletters, courses, CTF platforms and cheat sheets.
- [Appendices](docs/appendices/README.md) – glossary of terms and sample scope & rules of engagement.
