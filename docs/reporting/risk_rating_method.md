# Risk Rating Method

Risk ratings help prioritize remediation efforts.  A common approach evaluates **likelihood** and **impact**:

- **High likelihood / High impact** – immediate attention (critical vulnerabilities).  
- **High likelihood / Low impact** – address soon (security controls may reduce risk).  
- **Low likelihood / High impact** – consider mitigating controls; may warrant long‑term remediation.  
- **Low likelihood / Low impact** – monitor and schedule for future review.

Organizations may adapt industry standards such as CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) to generate numerical scores.
