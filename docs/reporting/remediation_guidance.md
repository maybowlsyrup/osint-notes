# Remediation Guidance

Well‑crafted recommendations help stakeholders fix vulnerabilities effectively.  Include:

- **Root cause** – explain why the vulnerability exists (misconfiguration, outdated software, flawed design).  
- **Immediate fix** – specific actions to address the issue (e.g., apply patch, validate input).  
- **Long‑term measures** – procedural or architectural changes to prevent recurrence (e.g., secure coding practices, network segmentation).  
- **References** – links to official documentation or best practices.

Tailor recommendations to the organization’s environment and resources.
