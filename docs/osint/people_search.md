# People Search

People searches involve finding publicly available information about individuals.  Use these techniques responsibly and respect privacy laws.

Strategies:

- **Search engines & social networks** – look up names, usernames and email addresses on Google, Bing, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, etc.  
- **Breached credential databases** – check if email addresses or usernames appear in known data breaches.  
- **Public records** – explore court filings, property records, professional licenses, and news archives.  
- **Cross‑referencing** – correlate findings from multiple sources to verify identity.

Always consider personal data protection laws in your jurisdiction.
