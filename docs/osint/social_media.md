# Social Media Intelligence

Social media platforms are rich sources of real‑time information about individuals, organizations and events.

Approaches:

- **Profile enumeration** – identify accounts on platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon.  
- **Content analysis** – review posts, photos, check‑ins and hashtags to glean insights about activities, locations and relationships.  
- **Followers & connections** – map networks to identify associates or related entities.  
- **API & scraping** – use official APIs or scraping (within legal terms) to gather structured data for analysis.

Exercise caution with data collection and consider privacy settings and terms of service.
