# Public Records

Many governments and institutions provide public access to records that can support investigations.

Sources:

- **Corporate registries** – company formations, directors and shareholders.  
- **Court systems** – filings, judgments and case information.  
- **Property and land records** – ownership and zoning information.  
- **Government portals** – procurement records, regulatory filings, licenses and permits.  
- **Academic & research repositories** – theses, grants and publications.

These records often vary by country and region; familiarize yourself with local access and privacy laws.
