# Domain & DNS Enumeration

Understanding domain ownership and DNS configuration can reveal a great deal about a target organization.

Techniques:

- **WHOIS lookups** – identify domain registration details like registrant, creation date and contact information.  
- **DNS record enumeration** – use `dig` or online tools to gather A, AAAA, MX, TXT and NS records.  
- **Reverse DNS** – map IP addresses back to hostnames to discover additional domains.  
- **Subdomain enumeration** – discover subdomains via wordlists, certificate transparency logs or search engines.

These methods help map the target’s infrastructure and potential attack surface.
