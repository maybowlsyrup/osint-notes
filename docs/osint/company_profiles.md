# Company Profiles

When profiling an organization, OSINT can uncover corporate structure, partnerships, products, financials and potential vulnerabilities.

Tips:

- **Official websites & press releases** – gather high‑level information on services, technologies and leadership.  
- **Business databases** – use sources like OpenCorporates, Crunchbase or SEC filings for ownership and financial details.  
- **Job postings** – analyze careers pages and LinkedIn postings for insights into technology stacks and internal projects.  
- **Employee footprints** – review public social profiles and blogs (respecting privacy) to infer processes or technologies used.

Understanding a company’s footprint helps refine testing scope and identify potential weaknesses.
