# Dark Web Basics

The dark web refers to hidden services accessible via anonymity networks like Tor or I2P.  While legitimate uses exist (e.g., privacy protection), it also hosts illicit markets and forums.  **Always use caution and follow legal guidelines when exploring the dark web.**

Beginners should:

- Learn how Tor works and configure it securely.  
- Use a VPN in conjunction with Tor for additional anonymity.  
- Avoid downloading unknown files or providing personal information.  
- Stick to research‑oriented forums or markets only if authorized.  
- Consider using specialized OSINT tools that aggregate dark‑web data to avoid direct exposure.

Remember: accessing or purchasing illegal content/services is strictly prohibited and punishable by law.
