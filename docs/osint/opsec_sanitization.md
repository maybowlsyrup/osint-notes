# OPSEC & Sanitization

Operational security (OPSEC) protects your identity and methods while performing OSINT.

Best practices:

- **Use separate identities** – create dedicated research accounts that don’t link back to your real name or organization.
- **Sanitize metadata** – remove identifying data from documents and images you share.  
- **Use secure connections** – route your traffic through VPNs and Tor when appropriate.  
- **Limit cross‑contamination** – never reuse usernames, emails or phone numbers across investigations.  
- **Maintain digital hygiene** – regularly update and patch your systems, and avoid logging into personal accounts during investigations.

Protecting yourself ensures the integrity of your research and reduces risk.
