# EXIF Metadata

Many digital photos contain **EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format)** metadata embedded by cameras and smartphones.  This data can include:

- **GPS coordinates** – latitude, longitude and altitude.  
- **Timestamp** – date and time the photo was taken.  
- **Camera make & model** – information about the device.  
- **Exposure settings** – shutter speed, aperture and ISO.

To extract EXIF data:

- Use command‑line tools like `exiftool` or `exifread`.  
- Upload images to online EXIF viewers (be cautious about privacy).  
- Check smartphone photo galleries (some apps display location data).

If GPS data is absent, other metadata fields (time, camera model) may still provide clues about where and when the image was captured.
