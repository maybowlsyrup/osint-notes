# Maps, Satellite & Street View

Mapping services provide detailed geographic context.  When verifying a location:

- **Google Maps / Bing Maps** – search for addresses or landmarks, view satellite imagery and 3D maps.  
- **OpenStreetMap** – an open‑source map that sometimes contains unique data.  
- **Street View / Mapillary** – view ground‑level perspectives to compare building facades, signposts and intersections.  
- **Satellite imagery platforms** – services like Sentinel Hub or Maxar provide multi‑spectral imagery and historical snapshots.

Overlaying your target image on these platforms helps confirm hypotheses about location and environment.
