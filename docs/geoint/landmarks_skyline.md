# Landmarks & Skyline

Unique landmarks or skylines can quickly pinpoint a photo’s location.  Features such as skyscrapers, mountain ranges, bridges or monuments serve as recognizable anchors.

Tips:

- Identify distinctive shapes and patterns in the skyline.  
- Compare with photos from online image galleries or city guides.  
- Use panorama views in map services (e.g., Google Street View) to match building outlines.  
- Consider elevation and perspective – mountain peaks or coastlines may be visible from specific angles.

Combining landmark recognition with other markers (language, signage, vehicles) increases confidence in your geolocation.
