# Time of Day & Seasonality

Environmental cues in an image can hint at the time of day and season:

- **Shadows and light** – long shadows suggest early morning or late afternoon; diffuse light implies overcast conditions.  
- **Vegetation** – blooming flowers or snow cover indicate seasonal periods.  
- **Weather patterns** – clouds, fog, rain or dust can provide regional and seasonal context.  
- **Human activity** – clothing (coats vs. short sleeves) and events (festivals) offer additional temporal clues.

When combined with EXIF data and local climate information, these indicators narrow down the possibilities.
