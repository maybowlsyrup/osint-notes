# Lighting & Shadows

The direction and length of shadows in an image can help estimate the time of day and the geographic orientation.  By comparing the angle of shadows with the position of the sun for a given date and location, analysts can narrow down where and when an image was taken.

Considerations:

- **Determine the shadow direction** – draw a line from the object casting the shadow to the tip of the shadow.  
- **Calculate sun azimuth** – use sun position calculators to match the shadow angle with potential times and locations.  
- **Account for tilt** – ensure the camera wasn’t angled significantly, as this affects shadow interpretation.  

Combining shadow analysis with other clues improves geolocation accuracy.
