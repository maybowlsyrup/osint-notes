# Camera Signatures

Each camera sensor leaves subtle artifacts due to manufacturing variations and compression algorithms.  Analysts sometimes use these signatures to identify the camera model or even the specific device.  While this technique requires specialized tools and is primarily used in forensic investigations, awareness of camera signatures can aid provenance analysis.

To explore camera signatures:

- Examine EXIF data for make and model.  
- Use tools like `PRNU (Photo‑Response Non‑Uniformity)` analysis to match images to sensors.  
- Compare patterns across multiple photos from the same device.  

This approach is complementary to other GEOINT techniques.
