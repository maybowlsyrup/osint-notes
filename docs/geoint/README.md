# GEOINT

Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) blends image analysis, geodata and open‑source information to determine the geographic location of objects or events【644517669742006†L42-L112】.  By examining visual clues, metadata and environmental patterns, analysts can infer where a photograph or video was taken【540845191998447†L64-L98】.
