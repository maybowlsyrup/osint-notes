# Error‑Level Analysis

Error‑Level Analysis (ELA) is a technique for detecting potential image manipulation.  It involves re‑saving the image at a known compression rate and then highlighting differences between the original and compressed versions.

Steps:

1. Use an ELA tool (e.g., `fotoforensics.com`) to upload the image.  
2. The tool produces a heatmap showing areas of different compression.  
3. Inconsistencies (e.g., some regions with higher error levels) may indicate past editing.

While ELA can suggest manipulation, it isn’t definitive.  Additional analysis and context are necessary.
