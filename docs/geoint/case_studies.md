# Case Studies

The following examples illustrate practical applications of GEOINT and OSINT techniques:

1. **Image geolocation via landmarks** – An analyst identified the location of a protest by recognizing a unique building in the background, then verifying it with Google Street View and satellite imagery.  
2. **EXIF metadata exposing sensitive data** – A social media post containing a photo with embedded GPS coordinates revealed the exact home address of the poster.  Sanitizing metadata could have prevented the leak.  
3. **Shadow analysis for time estimation** – By measuring the angle of shadows and using a sun‑position calculator, investigators narrowed down when and where a surveillance image was captured.  
4. **Combining OSINT & GEOINT** – A journalist used domain records, job postings and public social media to understand an organization’s structure, then geo‑located its office via architectural clues and mapping tools.

These examples underscore the power and responsibility that comes with GEOINT and OSINT work.
