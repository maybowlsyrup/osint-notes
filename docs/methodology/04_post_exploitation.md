Post‑exploitation (or escalation) involves maintaining access, pivoting to other systems, and assessing the extent of compromise.  Testers may attempt privilege escalation, credential harvesting, lateral movement and persistence【776739838610670†L494-L509】.

Typical activities include:

- **Privilege escalation** – exploiting local vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain higher privileges.
- **Lateral movement** – using the current foothold to access additional hosts or services on the network.
- **Data exfiltration & impact assessment** – determining what sensitive data can be accessed or extracted.
- **Cleanup** – removing artifacts and closing backdoors after engagement to restore normal operations.

Post‑exploitation ends with a thorough analysis and handoff to the reporting phase.
