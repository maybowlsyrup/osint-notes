# Exploitation

During exploitation, testers leverage identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute code on the target.  This can involve techniques such as SQL injection, cross‑site scripting, buffer overflows or brute‑force attacks【776739838610670†L487-L492】.  Tools like Metasploit and SQLMap automate exploitation and payload delivery【409000051131789†L181-L188】【183926488236454†L8-L33】.

Key considerations:

- **Prioritize impact** – focus on vulnerabilities that offer the most critical access or data exposure.
- **Maintain stability** – avoid crashing the target when possible; monitor system health.
- **Document every step** – record exploited vulnerabilities, payloads used and evidence of access for reporting.

After initial access, testers move into post‑exploitation to maintain and expand control.
