# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance is the first phase of a penetration test.  Testers collect publicly available information about the target from internal and external sources to understand the environment and plan subsequent actions【776739838610670†L445-L468】.  OSINT plays a major role here, as it involves gathering information from news articles, social media, government records, technical forums and other open sources【688378048637034†L240-L334】.

Typical activities include:

- **Passive information gathering** – using search engines, WHOIS databases, DNS records and social media to build a target profile without direct interaction.
- **Active information gathering** – sending limited requests (e.g., ping sweeps, network scanning) to determine hosts and services.
- **Social engineering research** – identifying potential entry points via human interaction such as email phishing.

Reconnaissance sets the foundation for later phases; thoroughness here improves the success of scanning and exploitation.
