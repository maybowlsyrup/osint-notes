# Reporting

A crucial aspect of penetration testing is communicating findings clearly.  In the analysis and reporting phase, testers compile a detailed report that describes the vulnerabilities discovered, exploitation methods, data accessed, and recommendations for remediation【776739838610670†L510-L524】.

A professional report typically includes:

- **Executive summary** – high‑level overview of the test goals, scope and critical findings.
- **Methodology** – description of phases and tools used.
- **Findings** – detailed description of each vulnerability, evidence, impact and risk rating.
- **Recommendations** – actionable steps to remediate or mitigate the risks.

Refer to the [reporting section](../reporting/README.md) for templates and guidance.
