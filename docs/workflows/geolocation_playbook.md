# Geolocation Playbook

Use this playbook to geolocate images or videos:

1. **Inspect the image** – identify visible clues: language, architecture, vegetation, weather and shadows.  
2. **Check metadata** – extract EXIF data for GPS coordinates and timestamps.  
3. **Reverse search** – upload the image (or cropped sections) to reverse image search engines.  
4. **Compare landmarks** – match visible structures with landmarks in map services or street‑level imagery.  
5. **Shadow analysis** – estimate time of day and orientation.  
6. **Correlate with other sources** – use social media posts, news and weather data to corroborate location.  
7. **Document findings** – include screenshots, coordinates and reasoning in your final report.
