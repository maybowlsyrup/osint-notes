# Lab Setup

Before testing, build an isolated lab environment to ensure you don’t disrupt production systems.

1. **Virtualization** – use virtualization software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware, KVM) to create test machines.  
2. **Networking** – set up an internal network or use host‑only adapters to isolate traffic.  
3. **Baseline snapshots** – take snapshots of your virtual machines for quick rollback.  
4. **Install tools** – load essential software (scanners, proxy tools, exploit frameworks) on your test systems.  
5. **Logging & monitoring** – enable logging on both target and attack machines to track actions and outcomes.

A well‑prepared lab reduces risk and ensures repeatable testing.
