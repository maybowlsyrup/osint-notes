# OSINT Playbook

This workflow guides you through a typical OSINT investigation:

1. **Define objective** – identify what you want to learn (e.g., determine an individual’s employer, find subdomains).  
2. **Gather basic data** – collect names, usernames, email addresses, domain names or IPs.  
3. **Expand sources** – query search engines, social media, government records, breach databases and dark‑web aggregators.  
4. **Link analysis** – correlate information to build profiles or find connections using tools like Maltego and Spiderfoot.  
5. **Validate findings** – verify information with multiple sources to reduce false positives.  
6. **Document & report** – maintain notes, record URLs and cite sources in your final report.
