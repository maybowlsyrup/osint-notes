# Network Assessment

When assessing networks, follow these steps:

1. **Define scope** – IP ranges, devices and services.  
2. **Reconnaissance & scanning** – gather open ports, services and OS details using network scanners.  
3. **Vulnerability identification** – use vulnerability scanners and manual techniques.  
4. **Exploitation** – attempt to exploit high‑impact vulnerabilities while maintaining network stability.  
5. **Post‑exploitation & lateral movement** – explore internal network segments and capture sensitive data.  
6. **Reporting** – produce a detailed report with recommendations.
