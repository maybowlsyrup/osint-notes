# Web Application Assessment

A structured approach for assessing web applications:

1. **Scope & authorization** – understand what features or subdomains are in scope.  
2. **Reconnaissance** – discover endpoints, technologies and frameworks used.  
3. **Mapping & crawling** – use tools like Burp’s Spider to map pages and parameters.  
4. **Threat modeling** – identify potential attack vectors (injection, authentication, access control).  
5. **Testing** – perform tests for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication and business logic flaws.  
6. **Manual review** – validate automated findings and explore complex logic manually.  
7. **Reporting** – document vulnerabilities, evidence and recommendations.
