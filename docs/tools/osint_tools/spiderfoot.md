**Spiderfoot** is an open‑source OSINT automation tool.  It automatically collects data from over a hundred sources (whois, DNS, search engines, social networks, etc.) and correlates the results.

**Features:**

- Highly configurable modules for scanning different data types (domains, IPs, emails, etc.).  
- Web interface for interactive investigations.  
- Alerts for newly discovered vulnerabilities or changes in an entity’s footprint.  

**When to use:** to quickly gather OSINT about a target without manually querying each source.
