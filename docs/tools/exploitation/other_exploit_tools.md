# Other Exploitation Tools

Besides Metasploit and sqlmap, many specialized tools assist with exploitation:

- **SearchSploit** – offline repository of exploit code and local mirror of Exploit‑DB.  
- **Impacket** – Python scripts for interacting with network protocols (SMB, RDP, etc.) for lateral movement.  
- **PowerShell Empire** – post‑exploitation framework for Windows environments.  
- **Buffer overflow frameworks** – tools like `pwntools` help craft and deliver custom exploits.

Choose appropriate tools based on your target’s environment and vulnerabilities.
