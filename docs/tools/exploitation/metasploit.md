# Metasploit

**Metasploit** is an open‑source framework that provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in developing and executing exploit code against remote targets【409000051131789†L181-L188】.  The Metasploit Framework includes:

- A large library of exploit modules and payloads.  
- An extensible architecture for custom modules.  
- Support for post‑exploitation tasks like privilege escalation and pivoting.  
- Auxiliary modules for tasks such as scanning and fuzzing.

**Usage:** The `msfconsole` interface allows testers to search for exploits, configure payload options and run attacks against targets.  Integration with database backends helps track sessions and results.
