# sqlmap

**sqlmap** is an open‑source penetration testing tool that automates detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and taking over database servers【183926488236454†L8-L33】.  It features:

- Automatic payload generation and injection.  
- Database fingerprinting and data extraction.  
- Bypassing of web application firewalls.  
- Execution of commands on the underlying operating system via out‑of‑band techniques.

**Usage:**

```bash
sqlmap -u "https://example.com/page.php?id=1" --batch --dump
```

This command detects injectable parameters at `id` and dumps the database contents.  Use `--batch` to accept defaults during exploitation.
