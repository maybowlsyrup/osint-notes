# Mapillary

**Mapillary** is a platform for crowdsourced street‑level imagery.  Users upload geotagged photos from around the world, which can be browsed through an interactive map.

**Use cases:** comparing your target image with street‑level photos to match landmarks or infrastructure; building datasets for computer vision projects.

**Note:** Always respect the licensing terms and privacy considerations when using user‑contributed imagery.
