# Burp Suite

**Burp Suite** is a comprehensive platform for web application penetration testing.  It consists of tools such as:

- **Proxy** – intercepts and modifies HTTP/S requests and responses.  
- **Spider** – crawls web applications to discover content and functionality.  
- **Intruder** – automates customized attacks (e.g., brute force, fuzzing).  
- **Repeater** – manually reissues requests with modifications.  

Burp Suite enables testers to map an application, identify vulnerabilities and exploit them within a single interface【77626864409100†L90-L140】.

**Usage:** Start the Burp Suite proxy, configure your browser to use it, and begin exploring the target application.  Use the Spider to map out endpoints and the Intruder to attack parameters.
