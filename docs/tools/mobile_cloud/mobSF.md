# MobSF

**MobSF** (Mobile Security Framework) is an automated framework for mobile application security testing.  It supports static analysis of APK and IPA files as well as dynamic analysis via an emulator or device.

**Features:**

- Extracts app metadata, permissions and API endpoints.  
- Identifies misconfigurations, insecure storage and code vulnerabilities.  
- Provides an API and web interface for integration with other tools.

**Use:** Upload an APK/IPA to MobSF to perform static analysis.  For dynamic testing, configure a device/emulator and run the app through MobSFâ€™s proxy.
